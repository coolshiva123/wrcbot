# Recommendations for Scaling `text_extractor.py` for Enterprise Use

## 1. Slack API Rate Limits
- **Issue:** Direct API calls for every command can quickly hit Slack’s rate limits, especially for `users_info` and file uploads.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Batch user info requests or pre-cache user data.
  - Implement exponential backoff/retry logic.
  - Monitor and respect Slack’s rate limit headers.

## 2. User Info Lookup Bottleneck
- **Issue:** `_get_user_display_name` fetches user info for every unique user, caching only per-process.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use a persistent, shared cache (e.g., Redis) across bot instances.
  - Preload user info for active channels if possible.

## 3. Memory Usage and Message Size
- **Issue:** All thread messages are loaded into memory and formatted as a single string.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Stream processing or chunking for very large threads.
  - Set a hard limit on the number of messages or file size.

## 4. File Upload Size Limits
- **Issue:** Slack has file size limits (1MB for free, 2GB for paid plans).
- **Mitigation:**
  - Truncate or split files if too large.
  - Warn users if thread is too big to export.

## 5. Concurrency and Thread Safety
- **Issue:** `user_cache` is a simple in-memory dict, not thread-safe or shared across processes.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use a thread-safe, shared cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
  - Lock or synchronize cache access if using threads.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging
- **Issue:** Errors are logged, but there’s no alerting or user notification for repeated failures.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add alerting for repeated or critical errors.
  - Provide more user feedback on rate limits or failures.

## 7. Slack Client Access
- **Issue:** The code checks for `self._bot.slack_web` or `self._bot.sc` for the Slack client, which may not be reliable in sharded/multi-process deployments.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Ensure all bot instances have access to the correct Slack client.
  - Consider using a centralized API proxy if scaling horizontally.

## 8. Blocking Operations
- **Issue:** All operations are synchronous and blocking.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use async/await or offload heavy work to background jobs/workers.

## Summary Table

| Bottleneck                | Impact                        | Mitigation                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Slack API Rate Limits     | Throttling, failures          | Batch/cache, backoff, monitor      |
| User Info Lookup          | Slow, excessive API calls     | Persistent/shared cache            |
| Memory Usage              | High RAM, slow for big threads| Stream/chunk, set limits           |
| File Upload Size          | Upload failures               | Truncate/split, warn users         |
| Concurrency/Thread Safety | Cache bugs, race conditions   | Use shared/thread-safe cache        |
| Error Handling            | Silent failures               | Alerting, user feedback            |
| Slack Client Access       | Inconsistent API access       | Centralize client, API proxy       |
| Blocking Operations       | Bot unresponsive              | Async/background processing        |

**Recommendation:**
For true enterprise scale, refactor to use persistent caching, async/background processing, and robust error/rate limit handling. Monitor usage and add observability for bottlenecks.
