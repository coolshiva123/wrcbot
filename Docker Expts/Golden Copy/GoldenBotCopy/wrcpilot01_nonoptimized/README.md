# WRCPilot01 - Golden Copy Bot Configuration

## Overview
This is a **golden copy** of a fully working Slack bot setup with interactive blocks support. All plugins are tested and working correctly.

## Key Features
✅ **Working Slack Block Actions** - Interactive forms with buttons work properly  
✅ **One-Time Usable Forms** - Forms are automatically destroyed after submission/cancellation  
✅ **Name Collection Plugin** - Collects and stores user names via interactive forms  
✅ **MyPriorLife Plugin** - Collects "prior life" responses via interactive forms  
✅ **Fixed SlackV3BlocksExtension** - Properly routes block actions to multiple plugins  
✅ **Enhanced UX** - Forms provide clear feedback and are replaced with status messages  

## Docker Setup

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t wrcbot:0.8 .

# Run the container
docker run -d --name wrcbot_golden wrcbot:0.8

# Check logs
docker logs wrcbot_golden --tail 50
```

### Available Images
- `wrcbot:0.8` - Latest version with one-time-usable forms feature

## Plugins Included

### 1. SimpleNameCollector (`simple_name_collector.py`)
**Commands:**
- `!collect_name` - Shows interactive form to collect user names
- `!names_list` - Display all collected names  
- `!clear_names` - Clear all collected names

**Features:**
- Interactive Slack blocks form
- Proper input validation
- Stores names with user information
- Success/error feedback with rich formatting

### 2. MyPriorLife (`mypriorlife.py`)
**Commands:**
- `!mypriorlife` - Shows interactive form for "prior life" responses
- `!plc` - Display collected prior life responses
- `!plclear` - Clear all prior life responses
- `!pltest` - Debug command to test plugin status
- `!plmanualtest` - Manual test of block action handler

**Features:**
- Interactive Slack blocks form
- Stores prior life responses
- Confirmation messages
- Comprehensive logging

### 3. SlackV3BlocksExtension (`slackv3_blocks_extension.py`)
**Key Fix Applied:**
- Removed early return that prevented multiple plugins from handling block actions
- Now allows both SimpleNameCollector and MyPriorLife to handle their respective buttons
- Proper routing of interactive events to all relevant plugins

### 4. Other Plugins
- `alive.py` - Basic health check
- `tryme.py` - Simple test plugin
- `block_life.py` - Additional utility

## Important Files

### Configuration
- `src/config.py` - Bot configuration (Slack tokens, etc.)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration

### Plugin Configuration Files
- `simple_name_collector.plug` - SimpleNameCollector plugin metadata
- `mypriorlife.plug` - MyPriorLife plugin metadata  
- `slackv3_blocks_extension.plug` - Extension plugin metadata

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Block Action Routing Fix
**Problem:** Only the first plugin with `handle_block_action` method was being called, preventing `MyPriorLife` from working.

**Solution:** Modified `SlackV3BlocksExtension._handle_interactive_event()` to:
```python
# OLD CODE (causing bug):
if result:
    handled = True
    return result  # <-- This prevented other plugins from being called

# NEW CODE (fixed):
if result:
    handled = True
    # Don't return here - let other plugins also handle their actions
    # return result  # REMOVED: This was causing the bug!
```

## Testing Guide

### Test SimpleNameCollector
1. In Slack: `@bot collect_name`
2. Fill out the form with your name
3. Click "Submit Name"
4. Should see success message
5. Use `@bot names_list` to verify storage

### Test MyPriorLife  
1. In Slack: `@bot mypriorlife`
2. Fill out the form with your prior life
3. Click "Submit"
4. Should see confirmation message
5. Use `@bot plc` to verify storage

### Verify Both Work Together
1. Test both plugins in sequence
2. Both should handle their respective button clicks
3. No interference between plugins

## Development Notes

### Key Learnings
- **Block Action Routing:** Multiple plugins can handle block actions if routing is done correctly
- **Plugin Isolation:** Each plugin should check if the action belongs to them
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and logging is crucial
- **Docker Rebuilds:** Code changes require Docker image rebuilds

### Architecture
- **SlackV3BlocksExtension:** Central router for all interactive events
- **Individual Plugins:** Handle their own block actions independently
- **Slack Client Access:** Direct access via `self._bot.slack_web`

## Deployment History
- **v0.1-0.6:** Development versions with various fixes
- **v0.7:** Golden copy with fully working block action routing

## Maintenance
- Keep this as a reference implementation
- Any new block-based plugins should follow the same pattern
- Test thoroughly before deploying changes
